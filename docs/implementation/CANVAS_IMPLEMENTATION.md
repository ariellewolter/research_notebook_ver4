## Data Structures

### CanvasElement Interface
```typescript
interface CanvasElement {
  id: string;
  type: 'text' | 'image' | 'table' | 'block';
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  content: any;
  zIndex: number;
}
```

### DrawingStroke Interface
```typescript
interface DrawingStroke {
  id: string;
  points: Array<{ x: number; y: number; pressure?: number }>;
  color: string;
  width: number;
  opacity: number;
}
```

## Touch Drawing Implementation

### Pressure Sensitivity
- Uses `touch.force` for pressure detection
- Fallback to default pressure (1.0) for non-pressure devices
- Pressure affects stroke width in real-time

### Stroke Smoothing
- Quadratic curve interpolation between points
- Smooth curve calculation for natural-looking strokes
- Configurable smoothing parameters

### Touch Event Handling
- Passive event listeners for performance
- Touch action prevention during drawing
- Multi-touch support for pressure detection

## Drag and Drop System

### Touch-Optimized Dragging
- Long press to initiate drag (500ms in touch mode)
- Visual drag preview with opacity
- Touch-friendly drag handles
- Smooth drag animations

### Resize Handles
- Corner resize handles for all directions
- Touch-optimized handle sizes
- Minimum size constraints
- Visual feedback during resize

## Canvas Navigation

### Zoom and Pan
- Zoom range: 10% to 300%
- Smooth zoom transitions
- Pan with mouse drag or touch
- Fit to screen functionality
- Zoom-aware grid rendering

### Auto-Expansion
- Canvas expands based on content position
- Minimum canvas size: 2000x2000 pixels
- Expansion buffer: 500 pixels
- Dynamic size calculation

## Content Block Types

### Text Blocks
- In-place text editing
- Multi-line text support

## Usage Examples

### Basic Canvas Usage
```tsx
import { CanvasView } from '../components/Canvas/CanvasView';

const MyCanvas = () => {
  const handleSave = (content) => {
    console.log('Canvas content:', content);
  };

  return (
    <CanvasView
      noteId="note-123"
      initialContent={{ elements: [], drawings: [] }}
      onSave={handleSave}
    />
  );
};
```

### Custom Content Block
```tsx
const customElement = {
  id: 'custom-1',
  type: 'block',
  x: 100,
  y: 100,
  width: 200,
  height: 150,
  content: { type: 'custom', data: 'Custom content' },
  zIndex: 0,
};
```

### Drawing Configuration
```tsx
const drawingSettings = {
  brushSize: 3,
  brushColor: '#ff0000',
  opacity: 0.8,
  pressureSensitivity: true,
};
```
