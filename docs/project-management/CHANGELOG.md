# Changelog

All notable changes to the Research Notebook v4 project will be documented in this file.

## [4.0.2] - 2025-01-27

### üêõ ObsidianLayout Component Bug Fixes

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Tab Key Collision Prevention**: Standardized tab key generation pattern to prevent collisions when multiple tabs are created simultaneously
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Fixed tab duplication to prevent memory leaks by filtering out large metadata objects
- **Race Condition Resolution**: Implemented proper split panel logic to ensure layout state matches actual tab group structure
- **Stale Closure Fix**: Added missing dependency in useEffect to prevent keyboard shortcut issues
- **Error Handling Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary try-catch blocks that were masking underlying issues

#### Technical Improvements
- **Consistent Tab Key Generation**: All tab creation now uses pattern `{type}-{timestamp}-{randomString}` for uniqueness
- **Clean Tab Duplication**: Duplicated tabs start with clean state without inheriting potentially problematic metadata
- **Proper Split Panel Implementation**: Split panel now creates actual tab groups instead of just updating layout state
- **Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts**: Fixed dependency array in useEffect to prevent stale closure issues
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Removed redundant error handling that was masking context behavior

#### Code Quality Enhancements
- **Standardized Patterns**: Consistent tab key generation across all tab creation functions
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and filtering in tab operations
- **State Synchronization**: Ensured UI state matches actual data structure
- **Dependency Management**: Fixed React hook dependencies for proper cleanup

#### Impact
- **Reliability**: Eliminated potential tab key collisions and race conditions
- **Performance**: Reduced memory usage through proper data filtering
- **User Experience**: More consistent and predictable tab behavior
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure

### üîÑ Breaking Changes
- None - All fixes maintain backward compatibility

### üöÄ Migration Notes
- No migration required - all improvements are backward compatible
- Existing tabs and workspaces remain unaffected
- Enhanced reliability and performance with no user-facing changes
