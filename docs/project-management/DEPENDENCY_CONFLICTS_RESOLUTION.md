### ⚠️ Known Issues (Cannot Be Resolved)

#### 1. xlsx Package Security Vulnerabilities
- **Package**: `xlsx@0.18.5`
- **Vulnerabilities**: 
  - Prototype Pollution (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)
  - Regular Expression Denial of Service (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)
- **Status**: ⚠️ UNAVOIDABLE - The xlsx package doesn't have versions >=0.19.3 available
- **Recommendation**: Consider migrating to `exceljs` or another actively maintained Excel library

#### 2. Deprecated Packages
- `@types/bcryptjs@3.0.0` - Deprecated
- `@types/xlsx@0.0.36` - Deprecated

- `react-beautiful-dnd@13.1.1` - Deprecated
- `multer@1.4.5-lts.2` - Deprecated
- `eslint@8.57.1` - Deprecated

## Actions Taken

### Package Updates Made
1. **Frontend (`apps/frontend/package.json`)**:
   - `@mui/icons-material`: `^7.2.0` → `^5.15.14`
   - `@mui/material`: `^5.18.0` → `^5.15.14`
   - `pdfjs-dist`: `^5.3.93` → `^4.2.67`
   - `@types/react`: `^19.1.8` → `^18.2.66`
   - `@types/react-dom`: `^19.1.6` → `^18.2.22`

2. **Backend (`apps/backend/package.json`)**:
   - No changes needed for dependency conflicts

### Installation Commands Run
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dedupe --check
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Resolved
- All peer dependency conflicts have been resolved
- pdfjs-dist security vulnerability is fixed
- esbuild security vulnerability is fixed
- All packages are now compatible

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues
- xlsx package security vulnerabilities (unavoidable with current package)
- Several deprecated packages (non-critical)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor xlsx usage**: Consider if the xlsx package is essential for your application
2. **Plan migration**: If xlsx is critical, plan migration to `exceljs` or similar

### Future Considerations
1. **Regular audits**: Run `pnpm audit` regularly to catch new vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency updates**: Consider updating deprecated packages when stable alternatives are available
3. **Security monitoring**: Set up automated security scanning for the project

## Verification Commands

To verify the current status:
```bash
# Check for peer dependency conflicts
pnpm dedupe --check

# Check for security vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# List all installed packages
pnpm list --recursive
```

## Notes
- The audit may still show xlsx vulnerabilities, but these are unavoidable with the current package version
- All other security vulnerabilities have been resolved
- The project should now build and run without dependency conflicts
